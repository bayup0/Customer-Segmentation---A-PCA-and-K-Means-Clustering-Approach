**Customer Segmentation: A Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering Approach** is my first major project on my journey to mastering Data Science. This project served as my capstone after I completed a book titled Practical Linear Algebra by Mike Cohen. Although this project incorporates diverse concepts, its primary focus is on the implementation of Linear Algebra, including fundamental concepts like matrix multiplication as well as advanced concepts like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which extend to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). I hope this work serves as a foundation for more advanced projects in the future. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
